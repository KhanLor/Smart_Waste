# ‚úÖ GD Extension Enabled!

## What I Did:
I've successfully enabled the GD extension in your PHP configuration by uncommenting the line in `C:\xampp\php\php.ini`.

**Changed from:** `;extension=gd`  
**Changed to:** `extension=gd`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Restart Apache

For the changes to take effect, you need to restart Apache. Here are your options:

### Option 1: Using XAMPP Control Panel (Recommended)
1. Open **XAMPP Control Panel**
2. Click **Stop** next to Apache
3. Wait a few seconds
4. Click **Start** next to Apache

### Option 2: Close and Reopen XAMPP Control Panel
1. Close the XAMPP Control Panel completely
2. Reopen it
3. Start Apache again

### Option 3: Restart your computer
This will ensure all services restart with the new configuration.

## ‚úÖ Verify It Worked

After restarting Apache:

1. Go to: `http://localhost/smart_waste/test_upload_permissions.php`
2. Look for the **GD Library** section
3. You should see: **"‚úì GD Extension is loaded"** in green

## üéâ Then Try Uploading Again!

Once GD is loaded:
1. Go to your profile page
2. Click the camera icon
3. Select an image
4. Upload should now work!

## üìù What GD Does:
- GD is a PHP library for image processing
- It's required to resize and optimize profile images
- Without it, the upload will fail when trying to process the image

## Need Help?
If you still see "‚úó GD Extension is NOT loaded" after restarting Apache:
- Make sure Apache actually restarted (check the XAMPP Control Panel)
- Try restarting your computer
- Check if there are any error messages in the XAMPP Control Panel logs
